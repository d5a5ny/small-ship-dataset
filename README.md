# small-ships-dataset
This is a ship dataset for small ships only. Most of the ship instances have a relative area of less than 1% of the input image. It consists of 3538 ships in 1416 images. The number of ships less than 1% is 2462 ships, and the number of ships occupies relative areas between 1% and 10% are 1058 ships. Only 18 ships have a relative area greater than 10%.  Such that, this dataset can be used to evaluate the detectors for small ships.
